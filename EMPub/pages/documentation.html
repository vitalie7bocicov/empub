    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The introduction section of Software Requirements Specification (SRS) outlines the purpose, scope, document
      conventions, intended audience, and an overview of the SRS. The main purpose of this paper is to provide a
      complete description of EMPub system by formulating the main problems it solves; providing feasible solutions to
      the problem.
    </p>

    <h3>1.1 Purpose</h3>
    <p>The Epub application is the software that is described in this paper. It is an extension of the standard mailer.
      Using this application, a mail user can easily share a message from his inbox, providing access to it to multiple
      friends in just one click.</p>
    <p>Throughout the documentation, we will present different use cases, and requirements in respect to the users and
      the system, and also outline the concepts that may be developed later. The paper specifies the projectâ€™s main
      audience, user interfaces, user interaction with the interface, hardware and software requirements.</p>
    <h3>1.2 Scope</h3>
    <p>The EMPub application focus on making messages from a mail client inbox public, so it can be seen by an unlimited
      or limited number of users. One of the most common use cases of our application is the situation in which a user
      what to forward a received email to a large group of colleagues. The current solution to this problem is adding in
      receive field of the letter email address of all colleagues. Therefore, we want to provide a platform in which the
      previous operation will take just a few clicks.</p>
    <h3>1.3 Intendent audience</h3>
    <p>This paper is intended to be read by developers and testers as detailed information will be provided in respect
      to the implementation of the application functionality, however, certain chapters of our documentation could be
      easily read by simple users. The second chapter Overall description describes application functionality and
      presents UML diagrams, and the first paragraph of the third chapter describes Users Interfaces are the
      documentation part intended for user reading.</p>
