The EMPub application focus on making messages from a mail client inbox public,
so it can be seen by an unlimited
or limited number of users. One of the most common use cases of our application is the situation in which a user
what to forward a received email to a large group of colleagues. The current solution to this problem is adding
in receive field of the letter email address of all colleagues. Therefore, we want to provide a platform in which
the previous operation will take just a few clicks.
