    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <section id="purpose">
      <h3><span>1.1</span> Purpose</h3>
      <p>The Epub application is the software that is described in this paper. It is an extension of the standard
        mailer.
        Using this application, a mail user can easily share a message from his inbox, providing access to it to
        multiple
        friends in just one click.</p>
      <p>Throughout the documentation, we will present different use cases, and requirements in respect to the users and
        the system, and also outline the concepts that may be developed later. The paper specifies the projectâ€™s main
        audience, user interfaces, user interaction with the interface, hardware and software requirements.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="scope">
      <h3><span>1.2</span> Scope</h3>
      <p>The EMPub application focus on making messages from a mail client inbox public, so it can be seen by an
        unlimited
        or limited number of users. One of the most common use cases of our application is the situation in which a user
        what to forward a received email to a large group of colleagues. The current solution to this problem is adding
        in
        receive field of the letter email address of all colleagues. Therefore, we want to provide a platform in which
        the
        previous operation will take just a few clicks.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="audience">
      <h3><span>1.3</span> Intendent audience</h3>
      <p>This paper is intended to be read by developers and testers as detailed information will be provided in respect
        to the implementation of the application functionality, however, certain chapters of our documentation could be
        easily read by simple users. The second chapter Overall description describes application functionality and
        presents UML diagrams, and the first paragraph of the third chapter describes Users Interfaces are the
        documentation part intended for user reading.</p>

    <h2><span>2.</span> Overall Description</h2>


    <section id="d1">
      <h3><span>2.1</span> Product Perspective</h3>
      This product is an extension product of the products intended for mailing, because within it it will be possible
      to publish emails for the target audience. This product will consist of several components, including a login
      component, a profile management component, an email management component in which emails will be received from
      mailing services and published on the site, and a database

    </section>

    <section id="d3">
      <h3><span>2.3</span> User Classes and Characteristics</h3>
      The classes of users who will be able to use this product are varied: from programmers who are interested in
      further
      developing the software to staff within a company / school or people who have nothing to do with technology,
      because
      the interface is friendly for anyone.

      <br />
      Another importat class of users are admins that could perform CRUD operation on users and mails.
    </section>

    <section id="d4">
      <h3><span>2.4</span> Operating Environment</h3>
      This product being a web application is implemented as web responsive, so it can be used as well on both computer
      /
      laptop and tablets / mobile phones. The minimum set of browsers that must be supported is:
      <ul>
        <li>Apple Safari</li>
        <li>Google Chrome</li>
        <li>Microsoft Internet Explorer</li>
        <li>Mozilla Firefox</li>

      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="d5">
      <h3><span>2.5</span> Design and Implementation Constraints</h3>
      This product is developed in PHP for the server back-end side and uses HTML5 and CSS3 in order to provide a
      responsive front-end interface.
      <br />
      An important component of Empub Application is MailParser Component which is design to serve as a sort of a server
      that will constantly listen to the inbox folder of empub.send@gmail.com mail address and will place incoming mails
      in a database. If the user how send the following email does not exist in database it will insert it.
      Some important technologies used in implementation of Java component are JavaMail to get mails with IMAP protocol
      and JDBC.
      <br />
      For application part was used PHP, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
      One the backend side was created the following services: mail service, login service, user service, statistics
      service. Together with services exists main application, which make use of the following services via ajax calls
      in JavaScript calls to display content.

    <section id="d7">
      <h3><span>2.7</span> Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>
      Technologies used in implementaion of the project are JavaMail, JDBC, PDO, PHPMailer.
      <br />
      The JavaMail API provides a platform-independent and protocol-independent framework to build mail and messaging
      applications. The JavaMail API is available as an optional package for use with the Java SE platform and is also
      included in the Java EE platform.
      <br />
      Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is an application programming interface (API) for the programming language Java,
      which defines how a client may access a database. It is a Java-based data access technology used for Java database
      connectivity. It is part of the Java Standard Edition platform, from Oracle Corporation.
      <br />
      PHPMailer is a code library to send emails safely and easily via PHP code from a web server. Sending emails
      directly by PHP code requires a high-level familiarity to SMTP protocol standards and related issues and
      vulnerabilities about Email injection for spamming.
      In the application it is used to send mails with passwords to users.
